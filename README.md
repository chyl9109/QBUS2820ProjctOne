Project One for QBUS2820

Hi guys, here is a short summary on how to get set up on git.

1) First of all, make sure you have downloaded git onto your terminal.
https://git-scm.com/download/mac

2) On main page of this repository, you should see a green button called clone or download. Click on it and you should see this address:
https://github.com/chyl9109/QBUS2820ProjctOne.git

3) On your terminal, navigate to the directory you want to save things to. 

4) Type onto your terminal:
git clone https://github.com/chyl9109/QBUS2820ProjctOne.git

This clones everything in the repository onto your laptop.

5) Type onto your terminal:

git init

You terminal should change and now have something saying git:(master)x

This means that you have initalised a git repository on in this directory.

Commiting things is like saving things.


Really good tutorials to explain everything:
